```groovy

compile 'com.miguelgaeta.android-media-picker:media-picker:1.5.1'

```

### Usage

First implement the `MediaPicker.Provider` interface in your Activities or Fragments.  Then open media chooser - presents the user with a chooser showing all matching activities for picking media:

```java

    MediaPicker.openMediaChooser(Provider provider, MediaPicker.OnError result);

```

Choosing media from camera:

```java

    MediaPicker.startForCamera(Provider provider, MediaPicker.OnError result);

```

Choosing media from gallery:

```java

    MediaPicker.startForGallery(Provider provider, MediaPicker.OnError result);

```

Choosing media from documents:

```java

    MediaPicker.startForDocuments(Provider provider, MediaPicker.OnError result);

```

Handling media result:

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    MediaPicker.handleActivityResult(this, requestCode, resultCode, data, new MediaPicker.OnResult() {

        @Override
        public void onError(IOException e) {

            Log.e("MediaPicker", "Got file error.", e);
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(File mediaFile, MediaPickerRequest request) {

            Log.e("MediaPicker", "Got file result: " + mediaFile + " for code: " + request);
        }

        @Override
        public void onCancelled() {

            Log.e("MediaPicker", "Got cancelled event.");
        }
    });
}
```

### Configuration

This library provides image cropping functionality via a dependency to Lorenzo Villani's [Crop Image](https://github.com/lvillani/android-cropimage).  When including this library add his repository to your `build.gradle` to obtain the dependency.

```groovy

allprojects {

    repositories {
        jcenter()

        maven {
            url 'http://lorenzo.villani.me/android-cropimage/'
        }
    }
}

```

For operations that require it, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions are added to the merged [Manifest](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html).  You do not need to add this permission into your own manifest.
